# Platformer game prototype
- The main propose of the project is the showcase of making platformer controller in Unity which has the the proper tight platformer controls without actually using "Physics" in Unity game engine.
- Also I tried to experiment some new Unity 2D tile systems in advance use (using nighbourhood rules, cluster patches, ...)
- All the pixel art and animations in this project is also done by myself (for more pixel arts follow me on twitter ;)
# How to run?
- Clone the repo, open it up with Unity (2020 is prefered) and start from the MainMenu scene which is in the Scenes/MainScenes
- make sure you had enabled the "2D Tilemap Extras" in the Package Manager
# Show me some gifs plz!
